### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew Hawkins. Based in Atlanta, GA (go Hawks!) and have been here for over a decade. I've been working in digital marketing in some form or fashion for a little over 13 years now and I feel like what my job requires changes daily. I jumped on to Github after reading more about it in the book "Out of Office." The company sounded great and I knew that playing around on here would help me get sharper on the technical side of marketing. I'm here to learn how to build other things on my laptop that aren't PowerPoint decks. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on trying to build out the digital capabilities as a multi-national law firm. I have been a marketing communications guy most of my life but am trying to learn more on the technology and data side of the business. I figured Github would be a great place to start. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about analytics, dashboarding and how to build out custom experiences on the Ceros platform. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding digital marketing, Salesforce, marketing automation, social media, or talk about your favorite TV shows and books with me. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: 

I'll respond to most everyone via email at <a href="mailto:drew@thebrainwads.com">drew@thebrainwads.com.</a>

I'm also open via Twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/drewhawkins">@drewhawkins</a>

âš¡ Fun fact: I have had a few crazy things happen in my life. 
<ul>
  <li>I've been bitten by a poisonous snake.</li>
  <li>Caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout when I worked on the south side of Chicago early in my career.</li>
  <li>An airplane crashed behind my house.</li>
</ul>

It all sounds unlucky but I consider myself one of the luckiest people on the planet for having come out of all those situations relatively unscathed. If anything, I can handle crisis situations a lot better for it.
