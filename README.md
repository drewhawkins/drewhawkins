### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**drewhawkins/drewhawkins** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on trying to build out the digital capabilities as a multi-national law firm. I have been a marketing communications guy most of my life but am trying to learn more on the technology and data side of the business. I figured Github would be a great place to start. 

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about analytics, dashboarding and how to build out custom experiences on the Ceros platform. 

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding digital marketing, Salesforce, marketing automation, social media, or talk about your favorite TV shows and books with me. 

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: 

I'll respond to most everyone via email at <a href="mailto:drew@thebrainwads.com">drew@thebrainwads.com.</a>

I'm also open via Twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/drewhawkins">@drewhawkins</a>

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have had a few crazy things happen in my life. I've been bitten by a poisonous snake. Caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout when I worked on the south side of Chicago early in my career. An airplane crashed behind my house. It all sounds unlucky but I consider myself one of the luckiest people on the planet for having come out of all those situations relatively unscathed. If anything, I can handle crisis situations a lot better for it.
